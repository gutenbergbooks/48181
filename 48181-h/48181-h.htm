<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> six wives described in this little
book are types which exist all over
the Christian world.</p>

<p>They may be found everywhere,
save in the Orient.</p>

<p>This does not signify that the unselfish,
tactful, tender and worthy
woman is not in the foreground in
the picture of life.</p>

<p>She is.</p>

<p>But her virtues, her nobility, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
her ofttimes sorrow, have all been
so frequently depicted, that many
women who are the creators of their
own misfortunes, fall into the error
of believing they belong to her
class.</p>

<p>It is the writer's impression, based
on observation, that a larger number
of men marry for love than do
women.</p>

<p>Just why so many men who begin
married life with love and ideals,
end it by being bad husbands, needs
a wider and more careful analysis
than this little book gives.</p>

<p>But it can do no good wife any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
harm to study herself, and in reading
these pages, try and discover if
she appears therein.</p>

<p>The noblest study of womankind
is herself.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">THE AUTHOR.</p>

<h2>SIX BAD HUSBANDS AND SIX<br />
UNHAPPY WIVES</h2>


<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">I</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first bad husband had been a
very good man until he married.
He had built up a successful
business and a fair name for himself, and
he had done it all without help, and
without harming any one else.</p>

<p>He climbed without pulling others
down; and he did little acts of kindness
as he went along, never hesitating to give
a dollar where he felt it was needed, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
when anxious about the coming of another
dollar to fill its place.</p>

<p>He helped indigent relatives; he aided
a widowed cousin to educate her daughter,
and always remembered the children in his
neighbourhood at Christmas time.</p>

<p>And when he was thirty-two, he decided
to settle down and have a home of
his own. He married a young woman who
had distinguished herself as a bright
scholar at college, and he took her away
from the drudgery of the schoolroom,
where she had been teaching for two years
after she graduated. He placed her in a
pretty home, and gave her every comfort
and all his love and attention.</p>

<p>The wife kept the home in good order,
and seemed to be very well satisfied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
her condition for a time. When people
praised her husband for what he had
accomplished alone and with no help,
rising from the ranks, as it were, to a place
of influence in life's army, she smiled and
showed satisfaction.</p>

<p>But after a year passed by she began to
wish her husband had acquired more polish&mdash;that
he had enjoyed better advantages&mdash;and
she found herself irritated by his
manners and his speech.</p>

<p>It pleased her immensely when any one
spoke of her as 'a superior woman.' She
related such compliments to her husband;
and he, too, was pleased, and told her
how fortunate he was to have won a wife
of such intellectual brilliancy.</p>

<p>Ofttimes he repeated similar compliments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to her; telling how proud he felt
when other people recognised his good
luck. But, little by little, the pride of
the husband abated; and just in proportion
to the growing self-satisfaction
of the wife. As she talked more, he
talked less; he grew taciturn; his speech
became halting, and his manner constrained.</p>

<p>They had been married five years when
this supposedly good and moral husband
displayed his badness. He brought home
a gift to his wife&mdash;one he had thought
would give her pleasure. She took great
pride in her house, and loved to decorate
it with odd and beautiful things.</p>

<p>So he had seen this vase in a window
and brought it to her, with almost the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
vanished look of pleasure in his recently
lined face.</p>

<p>The wife looked at it, and her brow
contracted. Then she said rather petulantly,
'Dear, you would be wise to consult
me before you buy anything for the
house; you must know by this time that
your own taste is not to be relied upon.'</p>

<p>Then the wife stood aghast as the always
gentle and kindly man burst forth. He
said:</p>

<p>'I will be DASHED if I endure this
any longer.'</p>

<p>Having heard his own voice say
'DASHED' for the first time, he grew
reckless and continued:</p>

<p>'I am tired of this life; tired of you. I
want you to leave me. I once thought I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was something of a man, but you have
convinced me that I am absolutely worthless,
save as a money-maker. You can
take my money and go. I will make
enough more to keep myself in comfort
and peace. You have convinced me that
my taste is vulgar; my manners bad; my
speech uncouth. You have convinced me
that you are a superior woman, and quite
as plainly, I am made to understand that
I am an inferior man.</p>

<p>'You have changed my open and
generous nature. I have never been
selfish or niggardly with you; yet you
have made me feel that I wronged you
by my liberality to my poor relatives.
You think I should save this money for
some future rainy day. I have grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
afraid of having any generous act of mine
known, lest it cause reproof and frowns at
home.</p>

<p>'You have made me afraid to talk in
your presence. You knew I was not a
college man when you married me, but
since our marriage you have convinced
me that I am an utter ignoramus. I am
thankful to any one who helps me to
improve my speech and manners in the
right way, for I am ambitious enough
to want to better myself as I grow
older.</p>

<p>'But you never permit me to tell a
story without taking the words from my
mouth and telling it over.</p>

<p>'You continually humiliate me in the
presence of other people by disputing any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
statement I make and trying to prove me
wrong and yourself right.</p>

<p>'No man of any self-respect can enjoy
himself in the society of a woman who
treats him in this manner; no man can
keep on loving a woman who treats him
so, and I confess that I no longer love
you, and want to go back to my old
bachelor freedom.</p>

<p>'My home is the last place on earth to
which I look for happiness, and my wife
is the last person to whom I look for
loving companionship.</p>

<p>'The very best impulses of my nature
I have to hide from you, because you do
not approve of my liberality and generosity.</p>

<p>'And you have convinced me so absolutely
that I am your mental inferior, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
I will no longer compel you to live with
me.'</p>

<p>Then this bad husband went out and
slammed the door and did not come back
again.</p>

<p>And afterwards there was a divorce
obtained on the grounds of incompatibility,
and the deserted wife told her
friends of the terrible language this bad
husband had used to her, and of his
brutal conduct.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>




<h2>II</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second bad husband was none
too good, perhaps, in the beginning.
But he had grown
thoroughly tired of the life he lived at
clubs and hotels, and from the very
depths of his heart he longed for HOME.</p>

<p>He had experienced every type of
flirtation which women make possible for
an attractive man from his freshman
college days to old age. He had come
to a state of mind where he questioned
if there were any really sensible girls and
trustworthy wives, when he met his fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and ceased to question, and simply
believed.</p>

<p>He believed he had met the perfect
woman. He told her how he longed for
a home, and he asked her to be his wife.</p>

<p>When she accepted him he was so happy
that he simply cast all his old ideas of
women to the winds, and with these ideas
he cast all the wisdom which he had
accumulated through his bachelorhood.</p>

<p>Ofttimes in the past he had said that
women needed to be governed; needed a
master; that they became petty tyrants
if given too much respectful consideration,
or when their wishes were consulted on
matters of any import to the husband.</p>

<p>Yet in face of all the bad things this man
had said about the sex, he began his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
married life by asking the girl he married
to choose the way she preferred to live,
instead of telling her how he wished to live.</p>

<p>Of course he had told her from the
beginning of his love-making, that he was
tired of having no home; that a club or
a hotel, with all the comforts money
could purchase, meant only four walls,
and that a home with a wife and love and
peace and order and system, represented
his idea of heaven.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when he said the wife
could choose her way of living, she
promptly chose a suite in an expensive
hotel, and, after a year, she expressed a
desire to go to Europe and stay through
the London and Paris seasons.</p>

<p>It was with reluctance that she came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
home finally, for she was a beautiful girl,
and she had been much admired abroad.</p>

<p>After their return the husband asserted
his wish again for a home, and, again
reluctantly, the wife consented. She
spoiled it all, however, by continually
talking of the distaste she had for domestic
obligations.</p>

<p>'I hate the sight of a kitchen,' she said,
'and I detest thinking about what I must
order for meals three times a day. And
servants are such hopeless problems; and
one is so tied down by housekeeping.'</p>

<p>Of course, with such an attitude of mind,
housekeeping became a burden; servants
proved inefficient; and the good wife of
this bad man found nothing to talk about
when her husband came home in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
evening but the trouble she had had in
the domestic realms.</p>

<p>A new retinue of servants appeared
regularly each week, and finally, after a
year, the home was given up and the
hotel became the retreat of the unfortunate
man and wife. She convinced him that
she was breaking down under the strain
of housekeeping.</p>

<p>A second attempt was made the next
year, with the same result, and after the
breaking up of that home the wife wanted
to go and travel in Europe with another
unsatisfied wife whose husband was too
busy to accompany her.</p>

<p>So she went away for three months and
her husband lived at the club.</p>

<p>When she returned she found the bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
man very dissatisfied and inclined to find
fault.</p>

<p>He said he wanted a home; he wanted
a domestic wife, and he wanted children.</p>

<p>Then the woman who bore his name
fell to weeping, and she sobbed out that
she was sorry she came home, if he only
wanted to scold her and find fault with
her; and she declared she was not
physically strong enough to become the
mother of children. She gravely hinted
that she was a victim of some serious
malady which would cause her death if
she attempted to be a mother&mdash;her
physician had told her so.</p>

<p>The bad man gave vent to an audible
sneer at this juncture. He said he knew
all about the doctors who told selfish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
unwomanly wives such stories, just to
please them and to keep them as his
patients. But, he declared, he understood
God's laws and the nature of normal
human beings well enough to know that
not one woman in five hundred, who was
able to journey about the world by land
and sea, and go sight-seeing and to attend
receptions, would in any way endanger
her life by becoming a mother if she took
any care of herself and desired the child.</p>

<p>Then the wife became very hysterical
and went home to her mother, and said
her husband had called her all kinds of
names; that he had made her homecoming
unhappy, and that she could
never live with him again. She said he
was a coarse brute, who lived wholly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the senses and did not understand a
delicate woman.</p>

<p>She grew so ill that her sympathetic
physician ordered an ocean voyage for
her, and she went abroad again. While
she was away her brute of a husband
became entangled in a love affair with
another woman. When she came home
the matter was public gossip! and everybody
said what a heartless creature he
was to carry on so, when his poor wife
was ill, and away for her health.</p>

<p>And so, after due season, there was
another divorce of an unhappy wife from
a bad husband.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>




<h2>III</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> third bad husband fell violently
in love with a very handsome
girl, and he was like a man in
a fever until he gained her consent to be
his wife.</p>

<p>He had been an only son of his mother,
and the girl was an only daughter of
typical, doting American parents.</p>

<p>She was a belle in a small way; admired
in her circle for her beauty, dancing, and
music, and generally considered an amiable
and virtuous young woman, who would
be a prize worth the winning of any man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The young man was equally popular,
and his success in the business world,
together with his education and social
standing, made him seem a very suitable
husband for the pretty belle. The husband
was popular in his club, and he was proud
of his athletic prowess and his good
fellowship with manly men.</p>

<p>When his fiancée asked him to bring
her a chair or a fan or to get her
shawl, and kept him busy waiting on
her he laughed with delight at the novel
tasks assigned to him, and felt that he
was a royal courtier in the kingdom of
beauty.</p>

<p>The engagement was a brief one; and
the wedding was a brilliant affair.</p>

<p>Everybody declared that it was an ideal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
union, and all the outlook was toward
perfect happiness.</p>

<p>They did not possess wealth; a simple
competence only, which enabled them to
begin housekeeping with one maid. The
maid did not stay long, and the first
cloud on the happiness of the home was
in the difficulty the young wife found in
keeping any maid more than a few months.</p>

<p>Soon after the honeymoon the young
husband realised that his position of
courtier in the kingdom of beauty was
growing rather difficult.</p>

<p>He was obliged to go to his office at
nine o'clock in the morning, but the
frequent intervals between the departure
of one maid and the arrival of another,
made a similar frequency of a breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
at the club or restaurant, and, before his
departure from the house, he was often
requested to 'be a darling and bring his
own lovey dovey a glass of milk and a bit
of fruit.'</p>

<p>Knowing that he had taken his 'lovey
dovey' from a home where she always
breakfasted in bed, the devoted husband
felt it his duty to make life as pleasant as
possible for her; yet the position of butler
and maid combined was not pleasing to
his manly spirit. Still he liked to be
obliging, and he continued to do her
bidding.</p>

<p>Between the basement kitchen and the
sleeping-room of the young couple, two
flights of stairs intervened, and it seemed
never to occur to the mistress of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
household that it was a hardship for any
one save herself to go up and down these
stairs a dozen times in a brief space of
time on errands for her comfort.</p>

<p>The husband prospered, and engaged
two more domestics for his wife. But
with increased service her demands increased&mdash;and
confusion instead of order
reigned.</p>

<p>Maids were called to the top floor on
trivial errands, while they were engaged
in duties in the basement, and they were
sent to the corner box to mail letters,
to the grocery store, or the chemist's, or
on errands a half-dozen times a day.</p>

<p>When they could not go, or when they
were not there, 'darling husband' was
commissioned to be errand-boy. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
seldom enabled to finish his cigar or read
his paper in the evening without being
asked to go up or down stairs, to bring a
chair, shawl, or book, or a box of bonbons
for his wife's pleasure, or to run to the
corner to get something she needed.</p>

<p>He became skilled in the work of a
lady's maid in the continual demand
made upon him to assist his wife in
fastening her gowns.</p>

<p>After three years the situation in which
the young man found himself began to
prey upon his mind. For it grew worse
instead of better.</p>

<p>'I am no longer a manly man,' he said
to himself, 'I am not the head of a house;
I am an employé of a pretty woman. I
am a combination of lackey, valet, butler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
head waiter, and maid of all work. I
haven't even a half day or an evening off;
not a regular weekly time I can call my
own, as most domestics have&mdash;I am going
to strike.'</p>

<p>But when he made his first protest his
wife became hysterical and sent for her
mother.</p>

<p>The mother said the husband was a
brute to refuse to bring up the breakfast
tray to a poor delicate woman, who had
an inefficient and inconsiderate servant.
Any man with half a heart, she said, would
have shown sympathy and kindness in
such a situation. One word led to another,
until a very unpleasant condition of things
existed in the household.</p>

<p>He told the mother-in-law that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
her daughter's fault that she could never
keep a servant; that servants would leave
when they were imposed upon and overworked,
and that it might, in time, be
possible for a husband to leave unless
greater consideration was shown in the
small matters of daily life.</p>

<p>He said there was no pleasure to be had
in a house with a woman who made every
human being under the roof a slave to her
caprices, and who was so utterly selfish
that she could not understand how any
one might object to being ordered about
on errands night and day.</p>

<p>This scene was only the beginning of
perpetual scenes. The husband began to
stay away in the evenings. He often
remained away at dinner, and the neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
wife wept upon her mother's sympathetic
bosom.</p>

<p>And in due course of time a separation
and divorce occurred. Looking back over
her married life, the wife was unable to
see wherein she had failed. And everybody
said she was such a beautiful woman;
so faithful; so amiable; so accomplished,
and so evidently fond of her husband.</p>

<p>But everybody had not lived under the
same roof with her.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fourth bad husband was a
popular man and much sought
after socially.</p>

<p>He was dearly loved by his relatives&mdash;his
mother, his sister, and a young cousin
who lived with his parents, and whose
orphaned childhood he had made bright
by his care. She was fourteen and his
young sister sixteen, when he married
the compelling woman.</p>

<p>He had always said he should never
marry until he met one who swept away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
all other considerations, save possessing
her. One day at a dinner party in the
house of a charming hostess, he met
her. And all considerations were at once
swept aside, and to win this girl for
his wife became the one thought of his
heart.</p>

<p>It was impossible for any woman to
have greater proof of a man's complete
adoration for her than this man gave this
girl. Everybody who knew him spoke of
his absolute surrender to her charms.</p>

<p>She seemed equally in love, and the
wedding followed closely on the announcement
of the engagement.</p>

<p>The young wife was pleasing in appearance,
cultivated and accomplished.
Society thought she was eminently suited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to be the wife of a man who had long
been such a society favourite.</p>

<p>The man's family welcomed her with
open arms. So unselfish, and kind, and
ever generous had this son, and brother,
and protector been, that he made those
who loved him partake of his own
generous nature. They had long urged
him to marry, to make a home for himself;
and when he chose the charming
girl they admired for his mate, they
were all ready to take her into their
hearts.</p>

<p>It is seldom one finds a really good
mother-in-law. As a rule the mothers
of men, especially, are petty and selfish
in their attitude to the son's wife. They
feel the woman's jealousy at the intrusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of another woman into the man's life.
It is the most common phase of feminine
weakness and injustice.</p>

<p>But this particular mother was utterly
incapable of anything but sweetness, kindness,
tender love and generosity toward
her son. She was broad and high in her
thoughts of him. She wanted him to
marry and to be happy.</p>

<p>Yet before he had been a husband three
months, a troubled look came into the
eyes of the good mother; the sixteen-year-old
sister had grown grave; and the
fourteen-year-old cousin became curiously
timid about showing her cousin and
protector the impulsive affection which
was in her heart.</p>

<p>And the man, the young husband, son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
brother, and friend, became constrained
in the presence of his family.</p>

<p>All this change had come about through
the unreasoning jealousy of the young
wife.</p>

<p>Despite the loyal love and romantic
passion which she had inspired in the
heart of her husband; despite the cordial
good will and affection shown her by his
family, she was jealous of the unselfish
love he gave any and every one besides
herself. She wanted to be the only
individual upon whom he bestowed any
mark of affection.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, she seemed to consider
this state of mind an evidence of her
great love; and she made no secret of her
jealousy. She expected her husband to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
feel complimented by her attitude of mind.
When he was annoyed or unhappy over
it, she accused him of a lack of love for her.</p>

<p>'If you really loved me, you would
understand,' she said.</p>

<p>All his former society friends, the women
who had entertained him as a bachelor,
she regarded with suspicion and dislike.
So open was her hostility that she soon
made herself unpopular; and invitations
to the homes of her husband's old friends
grew to be very formal affairs.</p>

<p>For a time the young husband sought
to overcome the jealousy of his wife by
yielding to her whims, and by devoting
himself more and more to her. But this
increased her tendency to tyranny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he tried to reason calmly with her;
but she was incapable of logical discussion.
She accused him of 'standing up for his
family and friends against his wife,' and
went into hysterical tears.</p>

<p>Finally, tired of scenes, he avoided any
reference to the subject, and decided to do
what he felt was just and right, and abide
by the consequences.</p>

<p>But the relations between him and his
family were robbed of all their old freedom
and happiness; he was in that most distressing
of situations&mdash;for a man with a
kind and tender heart&mdash;between his blood
relatives and his wife.</p>

<p>Socially he became a dead letter. His
wife had made herself so unpopular, and
her jealousy was so pronounced, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
society was glad to have its formal invitations
answered by formal cards.</p>

<p>Still there were women who liked the
charming and courteous man, and would
seek to enjoy a chat with him on every
possible occasion. These occasions usually
came to the knowledge of the suspicious
wife, and resulted in further accusations
of deception and intrigue.</p>

<p>One day the bad husband decided that
he had endured all he could endure, and
he deliberately gave his wife cause for a
divorce on statutory grounds.</p>

<p>'I always knew he was deceiving me,'
the unhappy wife said, and everybody
sympathised with her.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>




<h2>V</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fifth bad husband had been
the merriest and jolliest young
man in the neighbourhood
where he found his wife. He was twenty-nine
years old when he married, and his
wife was twenty-two. She was very
bright, and considered a leader in her
social circle.</p>

<p>The young man was so witty and so full
of fun, that he had always been popular
with girls and, indeed, with women of all
ages. Old ladies liked him; he made
them laugh and forget their sorrows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Young matrons liked him; he made
them forget they were not girls. And
spinsters liked him, for he seemed to be
just as happy when with them as with
young girls.</p>

<p>Such a fund of good spirits opened
the door of every circle to him. No one
analysed him mentally, to see whether he
was possessed of any profound learning
under the surface brightness and mirthfulness;
he was such good company that
he carried people along with him and
made life seem worth while wherever he
was.</p>

<p>His wife had found him delightful as a
lover; and, while she did not possess a
keen sense of humour, she was young
and care-free, and enjoyed the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
amusements. The two seemed very congenial.</p>

<p>The young man possessed a fair competence
and good business abilities. He
was popular with his associates, and there
was nothing to hinder their marriage from
proving a happy one. So it seemed in
the beginning.</p>

<p>After a few years had passed, the wife
developed intellectual tastes and took up
a course of study. The husband was
proud of her and encouraged her in her
pursuits. He was very much occupied
with business, and his wealth was on
the increase. Two children had blessed
the union, and he was very devoted to
them.</p>

<p>He had never been a church-going man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
but had helped charities and benevolent
institutions, and he believed in God and
immortality.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he lived in full enjoyment of
all the things of earth. He liked a good
meal, well cooked and served. He liked
a good cigar. He enjoyed good company,
music, cards, dancing, and fun and life.
He had never sought unworthy friends,
or low associates of either sex. But he
wanted people about him who were
optimistic, and who liked a good laugh,
and he did not care for the very serious
side of life.</p>

<p>He never read problem novels, or went
to see problem plays, and he delighted
in comic opera and humorous literature.
For several years his wife had been his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
comrade in all these things. But as she
developed intellectually, and as she studied
into the metaphysical thought of the
world, she seemed to be bored by the
things which had once given her pleasure.</p>

<p>It did not occur to her that she could
keep in touch with the human side of life,
and with her husband's tastes, and still
grow out into larger ideals.</p>

<p>She said one could not serve God and
Mammon, or obey two masters. And she
felt she must obey the call of her soul.
She forgot that the call of love is also the
call of the soul.</p>

<p>So her husband began to go to the comic
opera and the social dance alone or with
a man friend. And he began to find it
difficult to converse with his wife on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
subject of mutual interest. He felt she
was greatly his superior, and he was
ofttimes very lonely.</p>

<p>He did not give vent to many spontaneous
witticisms as of old, and for the
first time he felt he was ageing.</p>

<p>His wife talked of matters, and books,
and theories of life which seemed a million
miles away from his sphere of thought.</p>

<p>As time passed she grew more and more
spiritual, and she tried to make him realise
that he was on a very carnal plane, and
that his whole understanding of life was
wrong.</p>

<p>She indulged in long fasts; she went into
her closet for meditation, when he was
alone in the house; and she refused him
the expressions of love which of old had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
been spontaneously given. She told him
love was a thing of the spirit, that it needed
no physical expression. She read from
books of ancient lore, and tried to make
him see that only by living in the spirit,
wholly, could we make a place for ourselves
in the great spiritual kingdoms of the
universe, or develop our highest powers
here.</p>

<p>For two long years the man tried to live
on and make the best of his position, but
the wife had undertaken an impossible
task. She had striven to change a wholesome,
happy, good-hearted, loving human
being, into an intellectual æsthetic; to
turn a wit into a profound philosopher;
to paralyse normal and natural instincts
and appetites, and to force the man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
live only in the spirit, while yet in the
body.</p>

<p>After two years the bad husband developed.
He went where he found pleasure,
mirth, good food, good company.
He allowed his wife to go her way; he
went his.</p>

<p>They met at the divorce court.</p>

<p>There was no trouble about her obtaining
the divorce. Statutory grounds were
given and proved. The children were
given to the wife. The woman who had
won him away from his wife, according to
public comment, was a wholly inferior
person.</p>

<p>Then it was remarked that his wife was
always quite his superior; and that he
had, by the natural law of the world, gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
down to his own level. His wife received
the sympathy of the whole community;
and he was understood to be one of those
bad men who are incapable of appreciating
a good woman.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sixth bad husband was supposed
to be quite a model young
man until he married the girl
who was too good for him.</p>

<p>She was too good for any man, so everybody
said.</p>

<p>Such a pretty girl and a perfect housekeeper.
Her mother had been an invalid,
and the daughter had always taken care
of the home after her mother died. She
was a nurse for all the sick people in the
neighbourhood; and so unselfish with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
time, and strength, and money in doing
for the poor.</p>

<p>The young man felt that he was rushing
in where angels fear to tread, when he
asked her to be his wife; and he regarded
her as something little short of divinity.</p>

<p>He was a healthy, human man, and fond
of all the comforts of home. When he
saw what a perfect housekeeper she was,
his heart welled full of gratitude to heaven
for his good fortune.</p>

<p>Early orphaned, he had boarded from
early boyhood. Perhaps, because he had
never known a home, he had fallen into
some careless ways. He excused himself
in this manner when his wife first took
him to task for leaving his hat on the
centre table. He tried to remember that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
he must always hang his hat in the closet,
where it had a peg of its own, but when
he came in hurried with some special idea
in mind, he found himself forgetting.</p>

<p>And again the quiet, but decisive voice
of his wife reminded him. Then he sometimes
forgot to wipe his feet on the doormat.
When he did this, if the day was
damp or dusty, he was made to repent
it by seeing his wife follow him with a
floor-cloth or duster, wiping where his feet
had trod. When he rose from a chair
and forgot to place it where it had been,
against the wall, she set it back herself
with a quick, prompt gesture, which made
him realise his delinquency.</p>

<p>She often mentioned being very tired at
night, too tired to go out with him because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the unnecessary work she had been
obliged to do through the 'thoughtlessness
of others.' He knew that 'others' meant
himself.</p>

<p>His cigar ashes were a constant source
of annoyance to her. He tried to put
them in an ash-tray always; but sometimes
they would fall or scatter. She
brushed them up immediately. So he fell
into the habit of going to the club to smoke.
She was a most undemonstrative girl;
and what he had taken for maidenly
reserve, when he wooed her, proved to be
an utter absence of affection in her nature.</p>

<p>She believed in duty; that was her
great word.</p>

<p>One day when he accused her of not
really loving him, she asked him to point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to one thing where she had failed in her
'duty.'</p>

<p>Had she not kept his home in perfect
order?</p>

<p>Had she not been economical in expenditures?</p>

<p>Had she not kept his name free from
blemish?</p>

<p>Had she not&mdash;but at this juncture he
went out and slammed the door.</p>

<p>And as he went he quoted from Kipling,
saying: 'And now I know that she never
will know, and never will understand.'</p>

<p>One day he fell ill with a hard cold;
and then indeed she became the devoted
wife. A better nurse never lived. She
was simply delightful, while he was confined
to the house as her patient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>But the moment he was up and out she
became the nagging woman, with a mania
for order, economy, and neatness; and
all her tenderness and sweetness vanished
into the acrid and severe manner of the
thrifty housewife. She was a nurse and
missionary and housekeeper&mdash;not a wife.
And he was simply starving for love, for
companionship, for good fellowship, for
freedom, for happiness.</p>

<p>She was unable to see or understand his
needs, beyond those of an orderly house,
and a bank account which was not overdrawn.
She was utterly devoid of the
least touch of coquetry. Her severe, neat
manner of dress indicated her temperament.</p>

<p>One day he complimented the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of a young woman who was given to
plumes and ribbons, and who wore her hat
with an air of one who knew she would be
looked at by men.</p>

<p>'I think her type very loud and tasteless,'
his wife said coldly. 'She is the kind of
girl who would run her husband into debt
without a qualm of conscience, in order
to gratify her whims. But I begin to
think that is the type of woman a man
admires.'</p>

<p>All her judgments were severe. She
had no mercy for any human frailty. A
woman of that nature, who is perpetually
nagging a man for leaving a book in the
hammock, a hat on a table, cigar ashes on
the floor, or a chair out of place, and who
is cold and undemonstrative in her disposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
drives Cupid from the window,
or else flings wide the door for his departure.</p>

<p>When Cupid went forth from this home
the man went also.</p>

<p>And the world said:</p>

<p>'What a brute to desert that model
woman! Such a housekeeper! Such a
manager! And to think how she nursed
him whenever he was sick!'</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Chas. A. Berry</span>.&mdash;'In reading "The World Beautiful" I<br />
have derived more than pleasure, for I have been quietly<br />
translated from the world of worry which surrounds so many of<br />
us into the New Earth, which Christ has made possible for His<br />
people. This is a noble book, which, while it rebukes the<br />
follies and sins of our topsy-turvy society, fills the reader<br />
with desires after the heavenly life.'</p>
